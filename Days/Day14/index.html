    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    /* But team is just a reference to the original array, so we always go back
    to what it originally was. You can't make copy's of an array an update, because
    it will just be a reference. */

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    const team2 = players.slice()
    console.log(team2)

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players)

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    // with Objects
    const person = {

    // and think we make a copy:
    // const captain = person
    // console.log(captain)

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    const captain3 = {...person}

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    const dev = Object.assign({}, fer)
    console.log(dev)

    // this means that the 'Object.assign() is cloning just on the 1 level, meaning that everything deeper than that won't be cloned correctly'
    // dev.social.twitter = '@coolman'
    // then
    console.log(fer.social.twitter) // '@coolman'

    // fix around: (shake all the reference but it's called the "poor's man deep clone")
